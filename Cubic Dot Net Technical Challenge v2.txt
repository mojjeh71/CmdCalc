# Cubic .NET Coding Challenge
Write a text based, command line calculator.

It should be able to accept a string representation of a numeric calculation
as input and be able to solve the calculation so that the correct result is
displayed.


## Sample Data
The following is a sample of test data that could be submitted as input.

* 2 + 4 = 6
* 5 - 41 = -36
* 32 * -45 = -1440
* -12 + 45 - 3 = 30
* -3 + 100 / 4 = 22

** 3 + ((-4 * 5) / 2) = -7
** 3 + (-4 * 5) / 2 = -7
** 3 + -4 * (5 / 2) = -7
** 8*10+6/2 = 83
** -3-+100 This would be tricky

The solution should allow for future enhancement to provide custom operators.  For example, we may wish to implement a power operator using the '^' symbol.

## Additional Instructions

### Duration
As you work through the test data, it will involve more and more functionality
to be implemented so no need to complete it all but aim to spend one to two
hours on the problem.

### Format
To be done in your choice of C# and .NET version preferably either in [Visual
Studio][1] or [Visual Studio Code][2] (free versions are available for both with
the latter also running on Windows, Mac OS, or many Linux distributions).  If
you prefer not to install anything then [online development environments][3] are
also available.

Please zip up your solution and send it in before the interview.

### Quality
Treat it as a piece of code destined for production, feel free to use online
resources for inspiration and we will discuss the solution during the interview.
